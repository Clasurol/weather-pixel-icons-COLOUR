# Colour pixel weather icons

This is an edited version of Dhole's Monochrome pixel weather icons, coloured
in and edited very slightly in GraphicsGale. 

These were coloured in to resemble classic weathter icons from various
Windows 9x era weather programs e.g. WinWeather, Wetsock, MetaWeather.

They come in PNG format, and two sizes: 32x32 and 256x256.

Full credit to the original author for making these icons and releasing
them for free use.
